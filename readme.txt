The cross-validation experiment to compare LINSCAN to OPTICS is in "linscan_optics_comparison.py". The code requires JAX to be installed, and will be accelerated if a GPU is available.

To automatically install packages, use pip install -r requirements(_gpu).txt, where we include _gpu if you want to install cuda dependencies for a machine with a GPU.
